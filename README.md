# DNA-Identity-Analyzer
 This is a proposal project for Problem Solving and Computer Programming (PSCP).
 
 This tool is created to analyze the DNA line, an appearance of protein in molecule levels, locate the beginning of the DNA line, and the end of it.
 
# How to use
 1. Enter your DNA line to analyze.
 2. Press 'Analyze' button.
 3. Done!

When the program analyzed your DNA line, you can choose to export the result to a text file (.txt) with a specific destination folder.
